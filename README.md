# Welcome to Statistics World

Before I jump to Hypothesis there are few terminologies/concepts one should know:

**Population:** A population is the largest possible collection of items with a set of common characteristics. Size of a population is denoted by N. N may be finite or infinite.

**Sample:** A sample is a subset of the population. Size of a sample is denoted by n, n is always finite.

**Random Sample:** A random sample is a subset of the population where each unit of the population has equal chance of getting selected.

**Population Parameter:** A population is determined by its parameters. Population parameters are constants. A normal population is determined by its mean μ and variance σ2 (or standard deviation σ).

**Central Limit Theorem:** If the sample size is large enough (n ≥ 30) then, sample mean distribution of random variables follows a normal distribution with mean μ and standard deviation σ /√  n.

**Ineferential Statistics:** Inferential statistics makes inferences of population based on relations found in the sample. Inferential statistics help us decide whether the differences between groups that we see in our random sample data are strong enough to provide support for our hypothesis that group differences exist in general, in the entire population or it happened by chance.

**Confidence Interval:** A confidence interval refers to the probability that a population parameter will fall between a set of values for a certain proportion of times. In other words, it refers to the percentage of probability, or certainty, that the confidence interval would contain the true population parameter when you draw a random sample many times. 

Now we understand basic terminologies, Let's see What Hypothesis Testing is?

A **hypothesis** is a conjecture about a parameter of a population. Object of the hypothesis testing procedure is to SET a value for the parameter(s) and perform a statistical TEST to see whether that value is tenable in the light of the evidence gathered from the sample. All analysts use a random population sample to test two different hypotheses: the null hypothesis and the alternative hypothesis.

**NULL HYPOTHESIS**: Null hypothesis (H0) is the presumed current state of the matter or status quo.
**ALTERNATIVE HYPOTHESIS:** Alternative hypothesis (HA) is the rival opinion or research hypothesis or an improvement target.

Note that hypothesis testing is done on the basis of sampling distribution, the decisions made are probabilistic. Hence it is very important to understand the errors associated with hypothesis testing.
